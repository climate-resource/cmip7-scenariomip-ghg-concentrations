- Added `harmonisation_year` as an input parameter to the workflow. This is more robust than trying to infer the harmonisation year at various points in the code (because it allows us to verify that the provided year is possible, rather than needing to infer a single correct value). The harmonisation is checked when the emissions files are split into individual scenarios (among other places).
- Updated to the final scenario names: `vllo` -> `vl`, `vlho` -> `ln`
- Added a plot examining the transition from history to scenarios in `1100_create-esgf-files.py`
