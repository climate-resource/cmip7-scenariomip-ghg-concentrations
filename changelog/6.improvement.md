- Added `harmonisation_year` as an input parameter to the workflow. This is more robust than trying to infer the harmonisation year at various points in the code.
- Updated to the final scenario names: `vllo` -> `vl`, `vlho` -> `ln`
- Added a plot examining the transition from history to scenarios in `1100_create-esgf-files.py`
- Harmonisation is now checked when the emissions files are split into individual scenarios
