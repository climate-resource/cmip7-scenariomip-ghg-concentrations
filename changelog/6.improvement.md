- Added `harmonisation_year` as an input parameter to the workflow. This is more robust than trying to infer the harmonisation year at various points in the code (because it allows us to verify that the provided year is possible, rather than needing to infer a single correct value). The harmonisation is checked when the emissions files are split into individual scenarios (among other places).
- Updated to the final scenario names: `vllo` -> `vl`, `vlho` -> `ln`
- Added a plot examining the transition from history to scenarios in `1100_create-esgf-files.py`
- Switched to using complete scenarios from the emissions team rather than infilling ourselves. The infilling code is kept and now we check that the complete emissions we receive from the emissions team matches what we expect based on the infilling we used (if this check fails, it shows that the emissions team have infilled differently from what we expected)
- Added historical inverse emissions estimate for Halon-1202 based on WMO 2022 concentrations
- Removed spurious small negative values from inverse emissions calculations
- Fixed up running MAGICC in concentration-driven mode and plots in the marker exploration notebook
- Updated `scripts/create-latest-set-of-concentration-files.sh` to use a file that contain the final `vl` and `h` emissions values
- Updated prefect caching so it can handle inputs that are an iterable of paths (previously only inputs that were a single path were cached correctly)
- Added retries to tasks that involved downloading data
