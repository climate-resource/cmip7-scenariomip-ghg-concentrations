- relationship between this repo and https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs
    - this repo pulls information from the 'source ID' fine in input4MIPs_CVs,
      this file: https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/blob/main/CVs/input4MIPs_source_id.json
    - in there, it is looking for keys like 'CR-*', to make sure that the 'source ID'
      (think unique ID) we use is 'registered'/known to in input4MIPs_CVs
    - the trick we play is that we can point to a specific commit or branch of input4MIPs_CVs,
      and then this repo is still happy.
    - the idea of input4MIPs_CVs is make sure that the wider forcings team is aware of what is coming
      and can manage some of the metadata around all of these different contributions
      (that come from different people)
    - we write the files using this information, so we can't really get it wrong
      but doing it this way means this metadata is defined in one spot,
      so it's a bit easier to manage

- uploading to NERSC
    - raw docs are pretty good: https://docs.nersc.gov/services/scp/
    - command is something like `scp -r output-bundles/0.1.0/data/processed/esgf-ready/input4MIPs zrjn@dtn01.nersc.gov:/global/u2/z/zrjn/`
        - `-r`: recursive i.e. upload the folder and its structure
        - `output-bundles/0.1.0/data/processed/esgf-ready/input4MIPs`: the directory you want to upload
        - `zrjn`: zeb's username, yours will be something like fb.
          You can get this by logging into jupyter then looking at the start of your shell.
        - `dtn01.nersc.gov:`: where we want to upload to
          get this from the docs https://docs.nersc.gov/services/scp/
        - `/global/u2/z/zrjn/`: the path we want to upload to. This is just my home directory
    - move files to `/global/cfs/projectdirs/m4931/zrjn-tmp`, the 'staging' area effectively
    - update permissions
        - make all directories readable by anyone: `find /global/cfs/projectdirs/m4931/zrjn-tmp/input4MIPs/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;`
        - make all files readable by anyone: `find /global/cfs/projectdirs/m4931/zrjn-tmp/input4MIPs/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;`
    - send an email to Sasha (I'll give you email separately) to say, "Hi, these files are ready to be published"
