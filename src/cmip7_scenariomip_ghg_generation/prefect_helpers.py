    including a [PathHashesCP][] instance.

    from prefect import task

            parameters_output=("out_path",)

    task
        Task to submit to

    *args
        Arguments to pass to the task

    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments to pass to the task

        Result of calling [task.submit][] with `args` and `kwargs`

    Notes
    -----
    This behaviour isn't native to prefect.
    I can sort of see why, it relies on re-running a task just based
    on whether the output exists or not.
    In contrast, prefect's normal logic is:
    if a task has been run with the same inputs and same source,
    it should give the same output
    and outputs should not disappear because of behaviour outside the workflows.

    This is fair enough, but to get more 'Make'-like behaviour
    (where re-execution is triggered simply by deleting a file),
    I wanted something like this.
    Despite the relatively simple solution, this took a surprising amount of thinking.
    Maybe one day we split this out into its own package
    or make a PR back into prefect with the relevant pieces.
